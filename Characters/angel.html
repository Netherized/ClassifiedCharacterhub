    <p>Angel is a smug and apathetic impostor. They try to give off the impression they are better than you at all times. They are allegedly a new recruit for MIRA Inc along with Malus.</p>
    <p>Abandoned at birth Angel has a level of apathy for others, commonly ignoring others emotions for their own gain. They are willing to do almost whatever it takes to get their goal. When they get close to someone they become incredibly loyal, trusting them almost completely. Even in almost all of these cases, they know they come first.</p>
    <h3>Appearance</h3>
    <p>Angel is a white fuzz covered impostor with four gloved hands and two golden wings. Their rose visor has points on either side. Above their head floats a rose and golden halo, both connected.</p>
    <p>In their most common shapeshifted form, they appear as a light olive colored crewmate with a cubic rose visor. Their visor has little points on it. They also maintain a swirl on their cheek and a rose colored halo. In this form they have rubbery skin.</p>
    <h3>Abilities</h3>
    <h4>Divine Cloaking</h4>
    <p>Angel has the ability to become translucent for short periods of time while in the sunlight. During this period they can sneak around unnoticed, being invisible to the naked eye. When moving in this form, a slight shimmer can be seen, making them detectable. When touched directly or indirectly (through anything they are holding or wearing) they will be turned visible.</p>
    <h4>Weak Shapeshifting</h4>
    <p>Angel has the ability to shapeshift. When they do this they can change their body to look however they wish for a short period of time. They cannot change the color of their visor or remove the swirl mark on their cheek. Additionally, they cannot shift into dark colors, only light ones. In their shapeshifted form they are weaker than usual and cannot hold up in a fight.</p>
    <h4>Healing</h4>
    <p>Angel has the ability to heal minor cuts and bruises by touching them. This is draining on them and they will pass out if overused.</p>
